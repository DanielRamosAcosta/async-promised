/**
 * Like [`whilst`]{@link module:ControlFlow.whilst}, except the `test` is an asynchronous function that
 * is passed a callback in the form of `function (err, truth)`. If error is
 * passed to `test` or `fn`, the main callback is immediately called with the
 * value of the error.
 *
 * @name during
 * @static
 * @memberOf module:ControlFlow
 * @method
 * @see [async.whilst]{@link module:ControlFlow.whilst}
 * @category Control Flow
 * @param {AsyncFunction} test - asynchronous truth test to perform before each
 * execution of `fn`. Invoked with (callback).
 * @param {AsyncFunction} fn - An async function which is called each time
 * `test` passes. Invoked with (callback).
 * @param {Function} [callback] - A callback which is called after the test
 * function has failed and repeated execution of `fn` has stopped. `callback`
 * will be passed an error, if one occurred, otherwise `null`.
 * @example
 *
 * var count = 0;
 *
 * async.during(
 *     function (callback) {
 *         return callback(null, count < 5);
 *     },
 *     function (callback) {
 *         count++;
 *         setTimeout(callback, 1000);
 *     },
 *     function (err) {
 *         // 5 seconds have passed
 *     }
 * );
